                I felt blood seep into my fingers and I quickly dropped my blood can close to the bed, dragged her feet down so it'll be dangling and still give me my source of energy(Blood).
<br><br>
I felt her whimper, then came few mufflings, I knew she wasn't waking up anytime soon. I gave her 2mls of Ketamine Injection which is a strong anesthetic.
<br><br>
I looked at her face once again, smiled and said, "When I'm done with y'all, you'll learn to respect men"

            <p>"Is this what y'all want?" I said rhetorically knowing she's unconscious and not waking up anytime soon.
<br>
                I carried her unconscious body down to my "slaughter room" as i prefer to call it.
                
                This is my third prey this week, ive had enough of ladies of ladies that feel they can do better than men.
<br>
                I laid her on the bed and cuffed her arms over her head and tied her to the bed. I'm glad I got more that my usual 5 bedsheets per week.

<br>It was shiny and sharp as it glistened in the days of the sun that shine through the small opening in the window facing the bathroom.

<br><br>Yeah, that's my butcher knife, I gently cut her toes and dropped them into my toe bowl. I had various bowls for the various parts of the bodies of my preys. I'll probably grill those toes later.

        <div id="content1">Quiescent
           <p> My gown hugged my thighs closely as the rain added a tune to its drizzles. 

I stood sideways, ready for what was to come. 
My teeth, clashing against each other like there was an ongoing war in there. 

I felt the rain was the cleansing spirit sent to deterge me from the chaos in my soul.

Could this be the quiescent place I was to find myself?....

            <p>
                Write words inside me with your fingers.

<br>Sing me beautiful songs with your moans.

<br>Rummage my lips as you'd to your wardrobe.
<br>
<br>Slow strokes, loud groans as you fill me with the liquid running down your thighs.

Make love to me like it's your last.

        <div id="content3">I love you
            <p>
                We both had goals, but it was never achieved
We were both in love but it faded so soon.

<br>You've always said forever ,
When you left , I realised it meant "never"

<br>I sit down thinking of you like I've always done ,
I finally realise I'm not a thing to be abandoned.

<br>The pain so deep that it hurts so much ,
But wounds heal and I'll move on with my life.
